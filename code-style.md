# Basics

### Whitespace

Four space indentation.  No tabs.  Ever.  If you see a tab, kill it.

Break lines before high-precedence operators, where possible.  Continunation
lines indented 4 or 8 spaces.  

Line up parallel constructions on adjacent lines to show it clearly.  When
indenting to line up multiple lines, prefer round multiples of 4.

Blank lines:
- Within a function body, one to break code into "paragraphs".  
- Two after a function or method. 
- Three blank lines after a class.  
- Blank lines at the end of a file are fine.

Spaces:
- One space around operators.
- One space around assigment =, but not around = for keyword args.
- Generally, no space before or inside parentheses.
- One space inside (), [], {} comprehensions, to distinguish them visually.

- What about PEP 8?

  I don't much care.
